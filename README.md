# Sentiment and Emotion Analysis of the Black Mirror Series

This repo contains my Master's thesis and some of the scripts written to pre-process and analyze linguistic data 

# Short overview
The study presented in the work is based on the sentiment analysis of a custom-made corpus consisting of transcripts of episodes of the Black Mirror series(the Black Mirror Corpus) using VADER Sentiment Analysis library and statistical analysis of the frequencies of words
corresponding to particular emotions, classified basing on Martindale’s Regressive Imagery Dictionary. 
The research results allowed the identification of problems occurring in the analysis of longer texts, which could be solved by expanding the list of modifiers, adding rules for calculating the sentiment value in the case of word repetition, and applying POS tagging and word sense disambiguation. The results of the study show that sentiment analysis of films and television series, especially the automatic detection of dominating emotions, has potential use in the film industry. Additional information obtained as a result of such analysis can help to improve the parental control and film recommender systems.
